            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Lack of research.</li>
                <li>Poor project leadership.</li>
                <li>Not enough time to complete the project.</li>
                <li>Poor testing and quality control.</li>

            <h3>How would we gather the requirements of the user/client?</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Questionnaires: </strong>these are a set of questions that are given out to potential users for them to complete.</li>
                <li><strong>Interviews: </strong>these are face-to-face discussions between the developers and potential users. These will often entail asking questions to the users about the projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Observations: </strong>this is where the developers will observe users of the existing system to understand how it works.</li>
                <li><strong>Meetings: </strong>this is where a group of users sit down with an analyst to discuss the current system.</li>
                <li><strong>Document analysis: </strong>this is where existing documentation in the current system is explained.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Different stages of development</h3>
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>What is the problem? What does the software need to accomplish to overcome it?</strong></li>
                <li>A problem needs to be <em>defined</em> before it can be <em>solved</em> and the requirements established.</li>
                <li>There will need to be the consideration of many different factors. In the example of a data processing system, this could include the data, procedures, future and the problems with the current system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>What will the system look like? what will it be made of?</strong></li>
                <li>Depending on the type of project, the systems designer may consider any of the following:
                    <ul class="contents">
                        <li>Processing</li>
                        <li>Data structures</li>
                        <li>Output/Input</li>
                        <li>User interface</li>
                        <li>Security</li>
                        <li>Hardware</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Programming and testing</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>This is the part where the software is developed and checked to see if it works.</li>
                <li>A system needs to be thoroughly tested before installation to ensure that all errors are discovered and corrected.</li>
                <li>Programmers will often come up with a test plan, and testing their own code is natural - it usually runs in parallel with the creation of code.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>This is the stage at which the software will be installed where it needs to be.</li>
                <li>Coding and testing will be carried out, and errors will be traced and fixed. </li>
                <li>When everything is considered satisfactory, the software will be installed on the user's machine.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>This is where the development of the new software is evaluated to see if it's effective at it's job.</li>
                <li>This will come in the form of a post-implementation review, which will focus on the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A comparison between the old system and the new one.</li>
                        <li>An assessment of each aspect of the system against pre-set criteria.</li>
                        <li>What errors were made durng the development phase.</li>
                        <li>Unexpected advantages and issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>Methodologies</h3>
            <p>Methodologies are a structured and agreed way of doing something. In the context of software development, it's a framework used to structure, plan and control the process of developing a solution.</p>
            <h4>Waterfall Model</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Each step is completed one at a time, contigously. Each step has specific outputs that lead smoothly into the next step.</li>
                <li>It&#39;s possible to go back to a previous stage, but developers will need to work back down through the stages.</li>
                <li>The client is inolved at the beginning, but from there on has little input until the evaluation stage.</li>
                <li>The model is adopted from the manufacturing industry - it makes sense there since hardware made later in the project had high cost implications, so getting each stage right was important. But in software development, it has been superseded by more effective models.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Agile Model</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Agile is an iterative process heavily based on customer involvement throughout the development process, making use of small multitasking teams of programmers.</li>
                <li>The process starts with the creation of a prototype, which the customer gives feedback on.</li>
                <li>This model is suited to small groups of devs working together as opposed to large projects with developers working on seperate parallel parts.</li>
                <li>The methodology is reliant on face-to-face communication.</li>
                <li>At each stage, the a prototype is built with client participation to ensure the resulting system is built in line with their needs.</li>
                <li>RAD and XP development (explained below) are based on Agile.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Rapid Application Developmnent (RAD)</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Some very large projects may be developed over a long period of time - technology and user requirements will change throughout this.</li>
                <li>RAD involves workshops and focus groups as a way to gather requirements instead of a formal requirement document.</li>
                <li>Prototyping is used to refine the system in response to user involvement and feedback.</li>
                <li>Each part of the system is developed within a strict time limit - the outcome will still be good enough, even if it isn't perfect.</li>
                <li>If software components can be re-used, they likely will be.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Extreme Programming (XP)</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Software following the XP model is developed by a team of less than a dozen people working in a communal work space.</li>
                <li>Developers may freely share ideas and help each other in developmnent. In XP, code quality is important, and <em>paired programming</em> helps with this.</li>
                <li>The software is developed incrementally - this means that new expanded versions of the software package will appear on a regular basis.</li>
                <li>XP does have the issue of focusing on code rather than design, however.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Spiral Model</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>The spiral model uses structured steps but has the software developed in iterative stages. </li>
                <li>At the start of the process, the requirements are defined and developers will work towards an initial prototype.</li>
                <li>The cycle will continue until a refined product is generated.</li>
                <li>Each time around the spiral, the following activities are done:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Analyse</em> the requirements for the next prototype.</li>
                        <li><em>Design</em> the next version.</li>
                        <li><em>Implement</em> (code and test) the new prototype.</li>
                        <li><em>Evaluate</em> the new prototype, generating a plan for the next generation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
