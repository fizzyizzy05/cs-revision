# A-Level Computer Science Revision Website.

I've made a website with revision notes for A-Level Computer Science. Note that this is still WIP, but is being updated and worked on regularly. The live website can be found at roseleigh.dev/revision/cs. This repository will serve as a development ground while new pages and changes are made.

## Progress
### What's complete
- 1.1.1
- 1.1.2
- 1.1.3
- 1.2.1
- 1.2.2
- 1.2.4
- 1.3.1

### What's work in progress.
- 1.2.3 (pseudocode examples missing, otherwise it's complete)
- 1.3.1 

### What isn't in the works yet, but will be done soon.
- Unit 1 components past 1.3.1
- Mobile friendly site
- Light mode

### What will be made in the future but isn't a short-term goal
- Unit 2 work - I haven't studied so it would be a bad idea for me to try and commence development on it.
- Any Maths or IT content.
