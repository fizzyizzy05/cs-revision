            <h3>CISC and RISC processors</h3>
            <h4>Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>CISC processors have large instruction sets in order to accomplish as many tasks as possible with as few lines of code as possible.</li>
                <li>The average program only uses around 20% of the instructions on offer by CISC processors.</li>
                <li>Compared to RISC, less RAM is required to store instructions on CISC due to the code it produces being shorter.</li>
                <li>CISC processors have the disadvantage of being much more expensive to manufacture due to the circuitry being complex.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>CISC instructions</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Instructions have a variable number of bytes.</li>
                <li>Each instruction might take multiple cycles to complete. This is because the machine's hardware has complex instructions built in.</li>
                <li>CISC processors often use more power than alternatives, meaning that they produce more heat. This makes CISC unsuitable for devices with limited power available.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>RISC processors tend to have less instructions available than CISC.</li>
                <li>Each instruction performs a simple task, and take one clock cycle to execute. To do complex tasks, multiple instructions have to be combined</li>
                <li>The combining of instructions required to complete complex tasks means more RAM is required to store machine code.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>RISC instructions</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>Since each instruction has a fixed number of bytes, they take the same amount of time to complete.</li>
                <li>Timings can be calculated more properly, meaning that pipelining is possible.</li>
                <li><strong>RISC has mostly replaced CISC in processor design. </strong>It's simpler processor design means it needs less transitors - producing less heat. Mobile phones, tablets, and some newer laptops also use it due to it's limited power use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>CISC & RISC compared</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>CISC processors take multiple cycles to complete instructions, RISC will only take one.</li>
                <li>CISC instructions have a variable number of bytes, RISC will have a fixed number.</li>
                <li>CISC has many more instructions available than RISC.</li>
                <li>CISC integrated circuits are more expensive to produce.</li>
                <li>CISC requires less RAM to complete instructions.</li>
                <li>CISC produces more heat and uses more power compared to RISC.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Co-processors</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>A co-processor is an extra processor used to supplement the functions of the primary processor. An example use-case for one is rendering graphics. </li>
                <li>Co-processors typically aren't general-purpose processors. This means they won't have the ability to fetch instructions, do I/O instructions, etc. Co-processors only typically carry out a limited range of functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>GPUs are designed specifically with the purpose of processing and rendering graphics.</li>
                <li>GPUs have a parallel architecture with thousands of small and efficient cores used to render graphics and handle multiple tasks simulatenously.</li>
                <li>Personal computers tend to have GPUs on a graphics card, or alternatively embedded on the motherboard.</li>
                <li>Adding a graphics card typically speeds up the rendering of 3D graphics as the GPU has specialist instructions/circuitry and have the ability to apply the same instructions to multiple</li>
                <li>GPUs are increasingly a cost efficient way of increasing performance. GPUs have a significantly higher core count than most PCs, meaning that they are able to run highly parallelisable problems.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Multicore and Parallel systems</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Multicore processor:</strong> a processor with more than one processing unit. Each core has the ability to independently process instructions simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Multiple cores can be effective at speeding smaller problems, but often won't be enough for larger problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>There are two approaches to multi-core processing of data:</h4>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD): </strong>this is where the same instruction is applied to multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD): </strong>this is where multiple instructions are applied to multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
