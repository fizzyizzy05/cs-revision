            <h3>The CPU</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li>The CPU is the component of a computer that enables it to carry out instructions.</li>
                <li>It also contains it's own components - these include the Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, Dedicated Registers and various types of buses including Address, Data and Control.</li>
                <li>The CPU also contains cache, a super-fast form of memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Memory Types</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Registers: </strong>small pieces of memory used storing data located in the processor.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM): </strong>A form of memory that is used to store currently in-use programs and data</li>
                <li><strong>Storage: </strong>this could include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). These are commonly used to store the computer's operating system as well as it's permanent files.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Buses</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Address buses: </strong> used to carry the address of where data is going to or from.</li>
                <li><strong>Data buses: </strong>used to carry data from one place to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Control buses: </strong>used to carry control signals from the control unit to other parts of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Important: buses don't actually store any information themselves: they just facilitate it's transfer between different parts of the system</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of registers:</h3>
            <ul class="contents">
                <li><strong>Control unit: </strong>used to decode instructions and control the flow of data through the buses.</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): </strong>used to carry out arithmetic instructions and calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulator: </strong> used as temporary storage for the data being processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Program Counter (PC): </strong> used to store the address of the next instruction to be fetched.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Instruction Register (CIR): </strong> used to hold the current instruction being executed.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR): </strong> used to store the memory address where data in the MDR is about to be written to or read from.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Data Register (MDR): </strong> used to hold the data that has just been read from or is about to be written to main memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fetch, execute, decode (FED) cycle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When a program runs on a computer, it needs to be loaded into the main memory to be accessible by the processor through the FED cycle.</li>
                <li>The fetch stage causes the next instruction to be fetched from memory.</li>
                <li>The decode stage produces signals which control other parts of the computer such as the ALU.</li>
                <li>The execute stage causes the instruction to actually be executed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Opcodes and Operands</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Word: </strong>a fixed size group of digits which is stored in the processor as a unit.</li>
                <li>Opcodes are represented by the mnemonics like ADD, LOAD and HALT.</li>
                <li>Operands are either an address or an actual value; this depends on the processing mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What affects computer performance</h3>
            <p><strong>According to OCR, </strong>there are three main factors that can affect computer performance: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clock speed: </strong>this determines how fast the CPU is ran and how quickly instructions are ran.</li>
                <li><strong>Core count: </strong>this determines how many instructions can be ran simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>The amount and type of cache memory: </strong>this gives more space for data and instructions so RAM needs to be accessed less frequently.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pipelining</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pipelining is a tactic used by some modern processors in order to improve performance.</li>
                <li>It involves splitting up tasks into smaller parts and overlapping the processing of each part of the task.</li>
                <li>It's commonly used in processors used in PCs in order to split up the FDE cycle like an assembly line.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Different computer architectures</h3>
            <h4>Von neumann architecture</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This architecture has the basic components of a computer processor specified with a shared bus used for both data and instructions.</li>
                <li>This means it suffers from the von Neumann bottleneck because of the shared bus: this means either data or instructions can be retrieved, not both.</li>
                <li>Only has a single Control Unit and Arithmetic Logic Unit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Harvard architecture</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This architecture has seperate memories for both instructions and data.</li>
                <li>It features separate buses for instructions and data, meaning the address bus can be wider than the data bus.</li>
                <li>It's used extensively in embedded systems.</li>
                <li>Harvard architectures can be faster than Von Neumann due to the ability for data to be fetched in parallel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Contemporary architecture</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contemporary processors often incorporate aspects of both von Neumann and Harvard architectures.</li>
                <li>As well as the good features of Harvard and von Neumann architectures, contemporary processors could have some more advanced features such as pipelining, hyper-threading and integrated graphics with extra circuitry for graphics processing.</li>
                <li>Most mobile processors and even the latest Intel chips also use a big.LITTLE architecture with some slower "efficiency cores" used for less intensive tasks and faster "performance cores" used for more intensive tasks. This aims to increase the efficiency of processors.</li>
